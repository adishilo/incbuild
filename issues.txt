Issues:
1. When creating a folder after incremental is run, incremental ignores new file on that folder
2. When creating a folder and then starting incremental and then adding a new file to the folder - incremental creates a file named after the folder on the target
    - can be resolved by FR 1

Feature Requests
1. Configuration 'executeBeforeReady' field to have enum values:
    - 'Nothing': Do nothing when registering watches
    - 'MirrorStructure': Make sure the target folder structure matches that of the source
    - 'ALL': Execute all watches callbacks
